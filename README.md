# ROS-YouBot-Inverse-Kinematics
Trajectory path planning for KUKA YouBot, mobile manipulator using Inverse Kinematics for product handling and manipulation based on ROS framework (Robot Operating System) in Linux using C++ programming. 
It is a little bit non professional coding style. But I hope you will understand the
code.
If you need any further description let me know. I will try to explain you
with more details.

Let me know if it working for you or not , I will modify it accordingly.

Both the files are same and I modified the "hello-world" program file of
youBot. Scroll down in the main.cpp or main.txt file and you will see some
addition in the code. It is based on the collision avoidance technique.

The cordinate system is according to right hand rule. Positive X direction
is straight outward from the front of the YouBot. Positive Y direction is
on the letf side of the YouBot. Z is postivie in the upward direction.

The centre point of coordinate system is the center of base of the
manipulator mounted on the mobile platform. So all measurements are from
the point see figure "Zero Reference Point & Reference Position"

You will find the value of X and Y cordinates in the range of (plus-minus)
0.3 to 0.2 meters. And Z cordinates almost remains the same.

Some of the test results are also attached.

All dimensions are in METERS (m).

Feel free to contact me.
